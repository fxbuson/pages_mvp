# GitHub pages minimal viable product

This project is a minimal implementation of GitHub pages to serve as an example of the least you need to do to get a website going with it. **That includes**:

- Go on settings and choose which branch to deploy from (in this case, main)
- The "_config.yml file"
- An "index.html" page

There are also going to be some extra parts on the website with examples of functionalities I find important.
